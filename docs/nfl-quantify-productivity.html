<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> How Scouts Discover Talent</h2>
<p>Finding talent in the NFL plays a crucial role in building a successful team. With the current active value of contracts adding up to $19 billion dollars and the implications that salary caps have on future seasons, not only is scouting a high-stakes job, but one which has long-term consequences on a team’s well-being.</p>
<p>Ultimately, teams are looking for players that are productive and can help win games. There are two ways this is normally done. “Watching film” is the process by which scouts deeply analyze individual plays and identify productive players. Unfortunately, these analyses are time consuming and subject to the opinion or instinct of each scout. Consequently, this method doesn’t allow for a holistic view across the entire league and makes comparisons difficult. On the other hand, player statistics allow a more objective comparison, but currently used statistics are not necessarily a good proxy for player productivity. Specifically, they reveal much less about player interaction than watching the players on film.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-machine-equivalent-of-watching-film" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Machine Equivalent of “Watching Film”</h2>
<p>Although teams in the NFL have been slower than in other leagues to embrace analytics, recent data improvements have created an opportunity to better quantify player productivity. In general, the production value created in a play should not be credited to just one player. Football is a highly dynamic and interactive sport that is dependent on the simultaneous actions of many players. Therefore, the credit should be attributed to those involved both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>Consider this brief analogy from marketing analytics. Attribution models attempt to assign credit for a conversion or sale to various marketing channels. Up until recently, “Last Click” was a widely accepted model in which all the credit went to the last ad before the conversion. The effectiveness of a certain marketing channel would give a single channel all the credit for a sale when in fact multiple channels may have led to the conversion. A better method known as a “Multi-Channel” model attempts to probabilistically distribute the credit to each channel based on underlying data.</p>
<p>My company’s solution applies natural language processing algorithms to descriptive play-by-play (PBP) data to determine features such as the time of play, total production value, type of play, and direct players involved. In addition, each player in every game can now be tracked real-time through the use of sensors. The app joins the PBP data with the sensor data to find intervals for each respective play. Finally, deep learning is used to evaluate the proportion of production value that will be awarded to each player. The data can be operationalized to provide a more objective method for scouts to find players that meet the team’s needs - effectively, an algorithmic version of “watching film.”</p>
<p>Here is a more concrete example. PBP data states “(:09) (Shotgun) 12-A.Rodgers pass long right to 18-R.Cobb for 53 yards”. From this description, we know that the production value of 53 yards was created as a pass from Rodgers to Cobb. We also know the time of play, which is used to incorporate the sensor data. The evaluation of sensor data produces the proportion of the 53 yards that are to be awarded to each of the 22 players on the field.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Ways to Increase Predictive Power</h2>
<p>Although there can never be a true consensus on player productivity, professional scouts across the league are pleasantly surprised by the algorithm’s valuation of player productivity. The new statistics are used by scouts for comparative analysis and become an important factor in the decision to sign a player. Although a good indicator, historic productivity alone is not a perfect predictor of future performance.</p>
<p>Future iterations hope to increase predictive power by incorporating simulation of scenarios that may occur in the future. In other words, film will be simulated to assess how a player performs to changing factors.</p>
