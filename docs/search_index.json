This site contains my portfolio of projects from “Research Design and Applications for Data and Analysis” as part of the UC Berkeley MIDS program. Currently, this involves some conceptual data science problems, with more updates to come that include implementation. Abstract of Quantifying NFL Player Production via Machine “Watching Film” Finding talent in the NFL plays a crucial role in building a successful team. Scouting is both a high stakes job and one which could have long term consequences on a team’s well-being. The predominant ways that NFL scouts look for new players to sign include “watching film” and looking at player statistics, both of which fall short. The first allows for detailed analyses of players, but since they are subject to the opinion of individuals, it is difficult to reconcile measures of player productivity across the league. The latter allows for measures that can be agreed upon across the league, but fails to examine all the important and necessary details. In this proposal, I explore ways in which we could use data that have been made recently available for a comprehensive approach to measuring player productivity – ultimately leading to better decisions when signing players to a team. The methodology involves measuring player statistics, similar to those that are already measured, then to use machine learning algorithms that analyze real-time sensor data to attribute those statistics among all involved parties. Abstract of Predicting the Next Hit Song Major record labels alone invest around $4.5 billion anually on artists. Being able to predict the likelihood of a hit song by a given artist is an important first step to determining if that artist will be a smart investment for the label. About the author After receiving my BA in Economics and a minor in Music Technology from USC, I wanted to discover a career that could join the two fields. First I worked as an analyst in litigation and economic consulting, followed by my position at a marketing analytics company as a Data Engineer. Both positions helped me discover my love for data science, but I continued to maintain a strong interest in the music and entertainment industry. Now, I am in my first year of my Masters in Information and Data Science degree at UC Berkeley to learn and apply data science techniques to solve problems in the entertainment and media industry.

With the current active value of contracts adding up to $19 billion dollars and the implications that salary caps have on future seasons, not only is scouting a high-stakes job, but one which has long-term consequences on a team’s well-being. Ultimately, teams are looking for players that are productive and can help win games. There are two ways this is normally done. “Watching film” is the process by which scouts deeply analyze individual plays and identify productive players. Unfortunately, these analyses are time consuming and subject to the opinion or instinct of each scout. Consequently, this method doesn’t allow for a holistic view across the entire league and makes comparisons difficult. On the other hand, player statistics allow a more objective comparison, but currently used statistics are not necessarily a good proxy for player productivity. Specifically, they reveal much less about player interaction than watching the players on film. 1.2 The Machine Equivalent of “Watching Film” Although teams in the NFL have been slower than in other leagues to embrace analytics, recent data improvements have created an opportunity to better quantify player productivity. In general, the production value created in a play should not be credited to just one player. Football is a highly dynamic and interactive sport that is dependent on the simultaneous actions of many players. Therefore, the credit should be attributed to those involved both directly and indirectly. Consider this brief analogy from marketing analytics. Attribution models attempt to assign credit for a conversion or sale to various marketing channels. Up until recently, “Last Click” was a widely accepted model in which all the credit went to the last ad before the conversion. The effectiveness of a certain marketing channel would give a single channel all the credit for a sale when in fact multiple channels may have led to the conversion. A better method known as a “Multi-Channel” model attempts to probabilistically distribute the credit to each channel based on underlying data. My company’s solution applies natural language processing algorithms to descriptive play-by-play (PBP) data to determine features such as the time of play, total production value, type of play, and direct players involved. In addition, each player in every game can now be tracked real-time through the use of sensors. The app joins the PBP data with the sensor data to find intervals for each respective play. Finally, deep learning is used to evaluate the proportion of production value that will be awarded to each player. The data can be operationalized to provide a more objective method for scouts to find players that meet the team’s needs - effectively, an algorithmic version of “watching film.” Here is a more concrete example. PBP data states “(:09) (Shotgun) 12-A.Rodgers pass long right to 18-R.Cobb for 53 yards”. From this description, we know that the production value of 53 yards was created as a pass from Rodgers to Cobb. We also know the time of play, which is used to incorporate the sensor data. The evaluation of sensor data produces the proportion of the 53 yards that are to be awarded to each of the 22 players on the field. 1.3 Ways to Increase Predictive Power Although there can never be a true consensus on player productivity, professional scouts across the league are pleasantly surprised by the algorithm’s valuation of player productivity. The new statistics are used by scouts for comparative analysis and become an important factor in the decision to sign a player. Although a good indicator, historic productivity alone is not a perfect predictor of future performance. Future iterations hope to increase predictive power by incorporating simulation of scenarios that may occur in the future. In other words, film will be simulated to assess how a player performs to changing factors. "],
["next-hit-song.html", "2 Predicting the Next Hit Song 2.1 A Practical Use 2.2 What Makes This Different Than Prior Attempts? 2.3 Objective Decision Making on a Subjective Matter", " 2 Predicting the Next Hit Song 2.0.0.1 Keywords music, entertainment, spotify, soundcloud, audio, social media 2.1 A Practical Use According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, record companies invest around $4.5 billion dollars annually. Typically, signing a new artist to a record deal can cost anywhere from $500,000 to $2 million dollars, and approximately 1,500 artists have been signed in the last 12 months. For these businesses, predicting the likelihood of a song becoming a hit, could help make smarter investment decisions that lead to higher returns. 2.2 What Makes This Different Than Prior Attempts? The idea to churn out pop hits using statistical modeling isn’t completely new. There are a number of different methods in which models have been created to focus on this question, each with a unique set of interesting model features. In certain studies, models were created by analyzing the sonic, melodic, and temporal qualities from actual audio signals of the song. From a data availability standpoint, this is probably the most simple. However, there is more to music than just the physical audio qualities. Another group of features that could be useful are song meta data. Release year, associated artists and producers, biographic information about the artist, and genre-like tags are examples of such features. I say genre-like tags because many platforms such as Spotify or open source sites like MusicBrainz have created more specific clusters lately than traditional, and somewhat arbitrary, genres. This information could be used to cluster songs into different groups to perform optimal analyses for each song based on the attributes. Finally, there are some indirect measures, which may be the most useful. Consumers are a huge factor when it comes to the success of a song. A model predicting a hit song would be incomplete without considering consumer trends. What researchers found challenging using the direct audio signals to model, was that the models were accurate, but only for a window of time. In other words, the models would work – until they didn’t. Many of these changes could be based on changing consumer preferences in music. But, what if there was a way to model consumer preferences, and subsequently use that model to inform the models that are based on audio features. We’d be able to dynamically adapt the audio models based on the shift in musical preferences. This could be done with user data from streaming services such as Spotify or Pandora. For the consumer preferences portion, data accessibility will be a challenge. Although the underlying data is out there, there will need to be strong incentives for companies that have this data to share. Also, in terms of the model itself, predicting the success of a more “revolutionary” artist that is ahead of the current trend in music will be more difficult. 2.3 Objective Decision Making on a Subjective Matter People make decisions based on emotions all the time. When you’re consuming music, there is no disadvantage to this. You listen to songs you like, and there is no reason to measure it against other songs. In the context of business decisions, however, objectivity helps. Because music is such a hard thing for people to look at objectively, this tool could really help decision makers anchor themselves to the preferences of a population. Ultimately, record labels could plug in songs to this platform to see if there are early indicators of a rising star. Predicting the hit likelihood of an individual song, will not necessarily predict if signing that artist will be profitable overall, but it could be a very helpful indicator. The concept is, if an artist has many songs that are predicted to be a hit, they are likely to be a good return on the business’ initial investment. "]
