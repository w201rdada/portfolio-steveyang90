## How Scouts Discover Talent

Finding talent in the NFL plays a crucial role in building a successful team. With the current active value of contracts adding up to $19 billion dollars and the implications of salary cap decisions on future seasons, not only is scouting a high-stake job, but one which could have long term consequences on a team's well-being.

Ultimately, teams are looking for players that are productive and can help win games. "Watching film" allows scouts to deeply analyze individual plays, but these analyses are subject to the opinion or instinct of each scout. Consequently, this doesn't allow for a holistic view across the entire league, and comparisons are difficult. On the other hand, player statistics allow a more objective comparison, but currently used statistics is not necessarily a good proxy for player productivity. It doesn't take into account the intricacies that are exposed from watching the interaction of players on film.

## The Machine Equivalent of "Watching Film"

Although teams in the NFL have been slower than in other leagues to embrace analytics, recent data improvements create an opportunity to better quantify player productivity. One such improvement is the real-time location tracking of each player in every game through the use of sensors. The data can be operationalized to provide a more objective method for scouts to find players that meet the team's needs.

Consider this brief analogy from marketing analytics. Attribution models attempt to assign credit for a conversion or sale to various marketing channels. Up until recently, "Last Click" was a widely accepted form of the model, in which all the credit goes to the last ad that led to the conversion. The effectiveness of a certain marketing channel is then based on a single channel receiving all the credit for a sale, when in fact multiple channels may have led to the decision. A more recent method knowns as a "Multi-Channel" model attempts to probabilistically distribute the credit to each channel based on underlying data.

Analogously, the production value created in a play should not be credited to just one player. Football is a highly dynamic and interactive sport that is dependent on the actions of many. Therefore, the credit should be attributed to both those directly and indirectly involved. Using NLP, descriptive play-by-play (PBP) data is evaluated to determine features such as time of play, total production value, type of play, and direct players involved. Next, The PBP data is joined with the sensor data to find intervals for each respective play. Finally, Deep Learning is used to evaluate the proportion of production value that will be awarded to each player. This effectively is like an algorithmic version of "watching film."

Here is a more concrete example. PBP data states "(:09) (Shotgun) 12-A.Rodgers pass long right to 18-R.Cobb for 53 yards". From this description, we know that the production value of 53 yards was created as a pass from Rodgers to Cobb and the time of play which is used to merge with sensor data. The evaluation of sensor data produces the proportion of the 53 yards that are to be awarded to each of the 22 players on the field.

## First Iteration is Good, but Shows Limited Predictive Power

Although there can never be a true consensus on player productivity, professional scouts across the league are pleasantly surprised by the algorithm's valuation of player productivity. The new statistics are used by scouts for comparative analysis, and become an important factor in the decision to sign a player. Although a good indicator, historic productivity alone does not have enough predictive power.

Future iterations hope to increase predictive power by incorporating simulation of scenarios that may occur in the future. In other words film will be simulated to assess how a player performs to changing factors.
