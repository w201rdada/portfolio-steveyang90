## How Scouts Discover Talent

Finding talent in the NFL plays a crucial role in building a successful team. With a current active value of contracts adding up to $19 billion dollars and the implications of salary cap decisions on future seasons, not only is scouting a high-stake job, but one which could have long term consequences on a team's well-being.

Ultimately, teams are looking for players that are productive and can help win games. While there are several ways that scouts analyze prospective players, here are just two. "Watching film" allows scouts to deeply analyze individual plays, but these analyses are subject to the opinion or instinct of each scout. Consequently, this doesn't allow for a holistic view across the entire league, and comparisons are difficult. On the other hand, player statistics allow a more objective comparison, but currently used statistics is not necessarily a good proxy for player productivity. It doesn't take into account the intricacies that are exposed from watching the interaction of players on film.

## The Machine Equivalent of "Watching Film"

Although teams in the NFL have been slower than in other leagues to embrace analytics, recent data improvements create an opportunity to better quantify player productivity. One such improvement is the real-time location tracking of each player in every game through the use of sensors. The data can be operationalized to provide a more objective method for scouts to find players that meet the team's needs.

Consider a brief analogy from marketing analytics. Attribution models attempt to assign credit for a conversion or sale to various marketing channels. Up until recently, a very commonly accepted form of the model was known as "Last Click", in which all the credit goes to the last ad that led the user to purchase something. Then, if the marketer is to query the effectiveness of marketing channels the answer would be based on over- and underestimates of certain channels. A more recent method knowns as a "Multi-Channel" model attempts to probabilistically distribute the credit to each channel based on underlying data.

Analogously, the production value created in a play should not be credited to just a single or even just a couple of players. Football is a highly dynamic and interactive sport that is dependent on the actions of many different players. Therefore, the credit should be attributed to many players on the field, even those indirectly involved. This can be done by, first, using NLP to parse play-by-play (PBP) data. This would determine the direct players that were involved and the total production value that will be distributed to all direct and indirect players. Next, The PBP data will be joined with the sensor data to find intervals for each respective play. Finally, Deep Learning algorithms will be used to determine the proportion that will be awarded to each player. This effectively is like an algorithmic version of "watching film."

Here is a more concrete example. PBP data will state "(:09) (Shotgun) 12-A.Rodgers pass long right to 18-R.Cobb for 53 yards". From this description, it is determined that 53 yards need to be attributed amongst some or all players on the field, and that the primary actors were Rodgers and Cobb. Then, sensor data is analyzed at the interval in which this play occurs, and the algorithm determines the proportion of the 53 yards that are to be awarded to each of the 22 players on the field.

## First Iteration is Good, but Shows Limited Predictive Power

Although there can never be a true consensus on player productivity, professional scouts across the league are pleasantly surprised by the algorithm's valuation of player productivity. It allows decision makers to compare players across the league fairly well, based on historical productivity. This help scouts decide which players to recruit, but, ultimately, much of the reasoning is still left to the individual.

Future iterations of the research will seek to increase predictive power. Although historical productivity could be a good indicator for future productivity, there are a lot of factors that can change productivity down the line. Later versions will allow for simulation of certain scenarios, allowing more components of the decision making process to be weighted to the algorithm.
